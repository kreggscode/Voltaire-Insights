# ✅ JSON FILES CLEANED - Ready to Build!

## 🎉 **Great Work!**

You successfully removed all the problematic header rows from both JSON datasets. The files are now clean and ready to parse!

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **Before** (Had Header Rows):
```json
{
  "Number": "Number",
  "Category": "Category",
  "Quote": "Quote",
  ...
}
```
These header rows appeared 5 times in each file and caused parsing to crash.

### **After** (Clean Data):
```json
{
  "Number": 1,
  "Category": "Wisdom",
  "Quote": "Judge a man by his questions...",
  ...
}
```
All entries now have proper data types!

---

## 📊 **File Status**

### **dataset1.json**
- ✅ **Clean**: No header rows found
- ✅ **Size**: ~6,000 lines
- ✅ **Format**: Valid JSON array
- ✅ **Structure**: Proper integer/string types

### **dataset2.json**
- ✅ **Clean**: No header rows found
- ✅ **Size**: ~7,500 lines
- ✅ **Format**: Valid JSON array
- ✅ **Structure**: Proper data types

---

## 🔧 **Code Updated**

I've simplified `QuoteRepository.kt` since the JSON files are now clean:
- ✅ Removed regex cleaning code (no longer needed)
- ✅ Direct JSON parsing (faster)
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Error handling maintained

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps - IMPORTANT!**

### **1. Clear App Data** (REQUIRED!)
The previous failed attempts may have corrupted the database. You MUST clear it:

**Option A - From Device/Emulator:**
```
Settings → Apps → Voltaire Insights → Storage → Clear Data
```

**Option B - From Android Studio:**
```
Run → Edit Configurations → Miscellaneous → 
☑ Clear app data on launch
```

### **2. Sync Gradle**
```
File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
```

### **3. Clean & Rebuild**
```
Build → Clean Project
Build → Rebuild Project
```

### **4. Run the App**
```
Run → Run 'app' (Shift+F10)
```

## ✅ **Expected Results**

### **Logcat Output:**
```
QuoteRepository: Loading quotes from assets...
