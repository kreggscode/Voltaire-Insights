## 🤖 Pollinations AI Integration

### What Was Added

#### 1. **Dependencies** (`app/build.gradle.kts`)
```kotlin
// OkHttp for API calls
implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.12.0")
implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:4.12.0")

// Retrofit for REST API
implementation("com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0")
implementation("com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0")
implementation("com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1")
```

#### 2. **Internet Permission** (`AndroidManifest.xml`)
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

#### 3. **New API Service** (`data/PollinationsApiService.kt`)
- Complete Retrofit service for Pollinations AI
- OpenAI-compatible endpoint integration
- Request/Response models with proper serialization
- Configured with:
  - **Base URL**: `https://text.pollinations.ai/`
  - **Timeout**: 60 seconds (for longer AI responses)
  - **Logging**: Full request/response logging for debugging

#### 4. **Updated ChatViewModel** (`viewmodel/ChatViewModel.kt`)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Real Pollinations AI integration** (no more placeholder responses!)
- ✅ **Temperature set to 1.0** as requested
- ✅ **System prompt** that makes AI respond as Voltaire

**System Prompt:**
```
You are Voltaire, the famous French Enlightenment writer, historian, and philosopher.
You lived from 1694 to 1778 and were known for your wit, advocacy of freedom of speech, 
freedom of religion, and separation of church and state.
Respond in character as Voltaire, using his philosophical insights, wit, and wisdom.
Keep responses concise, thoughtful, and in the spirit of the Enlightenment.
Use quotes from your works when appropriate, and maintain a conversational yet intellectual tone.
You are passionate about reason, tolerance, and human rights.
```

#### 5. **Enhanced ChatScreen** (`ui/screens/ChatScreen.kt`)
- Added error state handling
- Snackbar notifications for connection errors
- Graceful error recovery

## 🎯 How It Works

### Chat Flow

1. **User sends message** → Added to chat history
2. **Typing indicator appears** → Shows AI is "thinking"
3. **API Request to Pollinations AI**:
   ```json
   {
     "model": "openai",
     "messages": [
       {"role": "system", "content": "You are Voltaire..."},
       {"role": "user", "content": "What is freedom?"},
       ...conversation history...
     ],
     "temperature": 1.0,
     "stream": false,
     "private": false
   }
   ```
4. **AI Response** → Parsed and displayed as Voltaire's message
5. **Context maintained** → Last 10 messages kept for coherent conversation

### Error Handling

If network fails or API is unavailable:
- User sees: *"Pardonnez-moi, I seem to be having difficulty connecting..."*
- Snackbar shows technical error details
- User can retry by sending another message

---

## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### Chat Features
- ✅ **Ask philosophical questions** - Get responses in Voltaire's style
- ✅ **Discuss his works** - AI knows about Candide, Zadig, etc.
- ✅ **Explore Enlightenment ideas** - Reason, tolerance, freedom
- ✅ **Natural conversation** - Context is maintained across messages
- ✅ **Witty responses** - Temperature 1.0 allows creative, varied answers

### Example Conversations

**User**: "What do you think about freedom of speech?"  
**Voltaire**: *"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. Freedom of expression is the foundation of all human progress, mon ami. Without it, we are but slaves to the tyranny of silence."*

**User**: "Tell me about Candide"  
**Voltaire**: *"Ah, my dear Candide! A tale of optimism tested by the cruelties of the world. Through his misadventures, I sought to satirize the naive philosophy that 'all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.' Reality, as you see, is far more complex."*
