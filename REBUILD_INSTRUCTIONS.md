# 🚨 CRITICAL: REBUILD & REINSTALL REQUIRED

## ⚠️ **Current Situation**

Your device is running an **OLD VERSION** of the app with:
- ❌ Old Compose BOM (`2024.02.00`) causing animation crash
- ❌ Old JSON files with header rows

The fixes have been applied to the code, but **NOT YET INSTALLED** on your device!

---

## ✅ **All Fixes Applied to Code:**

1. ✅ **Compose BOM**: Downgraded to `2024.01.00`
2. ✅ **Animation Dependency**: Explicitly added
3. ✅ **Experimental API**: Added `@OptIn` annotation
4. ✅ **Missing Imports**: All added to AboutScreen
5. ✅ **Drawable Resources**: Created XML book covers
6. ✅ **JSON Files**: Already clean (no header rows)

---

## 🔧 **YOU MUST DO THIS NOW:**

### **Step 1: Uninstall Old App**
```
Settings → Apps → Voltaire Insights → Uninstall
```
**OR** from Android Studio:
```
Run → Edit Configurations → Before launch → Add → Uninstall app
```

### **Step 2: Clean Build**
In Android Studio:
```
Build → Clean Project
```
Wait for completion.

### **Step 3: Rebuild**
```
Build → Rebuild Project
```
Wait for completion (should succeed without errors).

## 🚫 **DO NOT:**

- ❌ **Don't** just "Run" without uninstalling first
- ❌ **Don't** skip the Clean step
- ❌ **Don't** use the old APK

---

## 💡 **Why This Happens:**

Android Studio sometimes caches old builds. When you:
1. Change dependencies (like Compose BOM)
2. Add new resources (like drawables)
3. Modify data files (like JSON)

You **MUST** do a clean rebuild to ensure:
- New dependencies are downloaded
- New resources are packaged
- Old cache is cleared

---

You will have a **fully functional** Voltaire Insights app with:

### **Beautiful UI:**
- 20+ gradient category cards
- Voltaire portrait (circular frame)
- Professional typography
- Smooth animations

### **Rich Content:**

### **Advanced Features:**

- Text-to-speech
- AI chat with Voltaire
- Quote favorites
- Share functionality

---

## 🆘 **If Build Still Fails:**

### **1. Invalidate Caches**
```
File → Invalidate Caches → Invalidate and Restart
```

### **2. Delete Build Folders**
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .gradle, app\build, build
```

### **3. Sync Gradle**
```
File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
```

### **4. Rebuild Again**
```
Build → Rebuild Project
```
